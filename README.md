# Meteor's Actual ESLint Configuration

http://github.com/iDoMeteor/eslint-config-meteor-official

## Summary

Since I packaged up my own Meteor ESLint config based on Meteor's idealistic
configuration, I figured I should provide you with the one they are actually
using.  People seem to ask for it around the web, but it is, strike that - was
buried in the source code.

I hereby bring it to light for your linting pleasure.  I will keep it up to
date.

You can install my personal config with npm install -g eslint-config-meteor
and view it @ http://github.com/iDoMeteor/eslint-config-meteor where you
will also find a thorough description.
